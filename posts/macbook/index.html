<p>The 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro has arrived and we’re seeing the first reviews land today taking a closer look at Apple’s latest notebook with the reliable Magic Keyboard. No surprises overall but take a look below as The Verge, TechCrunch, Engadget, Jason Snell, MKBHD, and UrAvgConsumer highlight why the new 13-inch MacBook Pro is a “strong and safe bet” and also the “awkward middle child” of the MacBook lineup.</p>
<p>The three big changes for the 13-inch MacBook Pro include the long-awaited switch from the butterfly keyboard to the scissor switch Magic Keyboard, double the base storage (now 256GB), and 10th gen Intel processors in the higher-end models that start at $1,799.</p>
<p>YouTuber UrAvgConsumer highlights that the 13-inch MacBook Pro is another choice for users to consider when figuring out the right balance of portability and power. But again, he notes that if you really value/need power, you’ll likely want to look at the 16-inch MacBook Pro and if you’re looking for portability for general use, the MacBook Air is likely the best bet.</p>
