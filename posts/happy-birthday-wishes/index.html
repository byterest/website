<p>Best Happy Birthday Wishes and Messages for Your Friend</p>

<p>As friends go, you’re not one of the best. You’re THE best! May this year’s birthday be the best ever for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happy birthday to my best friend, who is better than the best of the best! May your special day be better than the best you’ve ever celebrated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For your special day, I tried to find the right words to show you how I feel about our friendship. I could only think of one: amazing. To me, you’re an amazing friend, more special than anyone I’ve ever known. Happy birthday!</p>
</li>

<p>Happy birthday, my BFF! Today is all about you, so let’s make it all about the things that make you happy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My friend, I hope you have a glorious morning, a beautiful day and an exhilarating night on your birthday!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Congrats on your birthday! May it bring you all the joy, laughter and love you wish for!</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>I only have the warmest birthday greetings to a friend who has always had my back through thick and thin! May you enjoy the amazing things life brings BFFs like you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good friends don’t let friends like you have a terrible birthday. Best friends make sure friends like you have the best birthday ever. It’s an honor and privilege to be your best friend. Happy birthday, BFF! Now, let’s party!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s wonderful to have you in my world! Friends like you are as rare as a warm, sunny day in February. You’re truly one of a kind. Happy birthday, my dearest friend!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With a friend like you, each and every day is a celebration. Your birthday, for me, is even a bigger celebration, perhaps the biggest of the year (after mine, of course). Happy birthday, BFF!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A great friend once said to me, “No matter where you are, you might as well enjoy yourself.” That friend was (and still is) you. Today, I’m where I want to be — with you — enjoying every moment of your special day. Happy birthday, pal!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have only one wish for a friend like you: may all your birthday wishes come true, adding up to 24 birthday hours of joy, wonder, warmth, hope, wisdom and, most of all, love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I stumbled upon you, my “stumbling through the dark” days were over — all because you cared enough to light the way to a wonderful friendship. Happy birthday, BFF!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May you celebrate your birthday with as many good friends as it takes to get it right, get through it and/or get what you want. You can definitely count me as one of them. Now, let’s party!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To me, you’re a friend with benefits — the ones that really matter, like loyalty, support, trust, respect, kindness, honesty and, of course, free Candy Crush lives. Happy birthday, buddy!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You support me, listen to me, appreciate me, respect me, advise me, amuse me, cry with me and, most importantly, let me be your friend… so I can do all these things and more for you. Happy birthday, BFF!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My dear, dear friend, you have always been there for me. You and I redefine what friendship means. Happy birthday!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will be close friends our entire lives — you can bet your fortune on it. That’s how sure I am that we will always be able to go through thick and thin together (and I’m not talking about dieting). Happy birthday!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happy birthday! As long as you have me as a friend, you’ll never have to worry about going it alone. You’ll always have my shoulder to lean on, my ears to hear what ails you and all my heart to get you back on the right track.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happy birthday to a friend who has always been there for me. From the corniest recesses of my mind, I just want to say, “Thank you for being my BFF.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The world may be crazy, but not us. Things may change, but not us. People may take each other for granted, but not us. That’s because we’re the best of friends. From one BFF to another, have a great birthday!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your birthday, like our friendship, should be a celebration of everything good and plenty (like every piece of your birthday cake and every bite of your birthday ice cream).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wouldn’t be anywhere else but here with you on your birthday. In fact, I wouldn’t be anywhere else the rest of the year. You’re a great company. Happy birthday to my everyday friend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know I always say I’m incredibly fortunate to have a friend like you, but I can’t say it enough, especially on your birthday. You’re purely (and impurely) a wonderful pal. Happy birthday!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope we can enjoy every aspect of our amazing friendship for many, many, many more birthdays in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With a friend like you, every day of the year we spend together is a celebration. Just imagine how much more of a celebration your special day will be. I’m talking EPIC! Let’s start your party right now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To merely say that I’m grateful to have you as my friend would be the understatement of the century. I’m not just grateful — I’m mystified, electrified, stupefied, maximized and solidified to count you among my friends. Happy birthday!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happy birthday to a special person: you! When all my fair-weather friends are nowhere to be seen during the stormy times of my life, you throw me a life preserver to keep me afloat. That makes you either crazy or a great friend. You’re probably both!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It seems like only yesterday when we met each other and instantly became friends, yet it was years ago. Happy birthday to one of my, if I dare say, oldest friends (with the youngest outlook on life anywhere).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money can’t buy you friendship. Friendship is free… if you can find it in your heart. I’ve found it with you. Happy birthday, pal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are a gift that has come into my life. Now every day I get to enjoy the greatest gift of all. Our friendship. Happy birthday!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fair-weather friends are a dime a dozen. As a friend, you’re priceless! I wouldn’t trade you for all the diamonds, pearls, gems, sapphires and rubies in the world. Have an incredibly happy birthday!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know what makes a good friend. It’s so obvious. It’s whatever you do. Happy birthday to my best friend forever and a day!</p>
