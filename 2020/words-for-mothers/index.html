<p>I heard that God couldn&rsquo;t be everywhere, so he created Mom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I met my mother when she was only 23 years old, and I imagine that the first time my mother met me must have been the most beautiful time of her life. It&rsquo;s just that at the time I must have been crying constantly, so I forgot to look at my mom at her best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may be a little disappointed in me from time to time, and I will complain about your ranting. But we both know that we are the one percent in each other&rsquo;s eyes forever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My life began with opening my eyes and falling in love with your smile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For all the tenderness and romance in the world, don&rsquo;t forget to save one for your mother.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I used to think that my mother was not afraid of anything, but then I realized that she was also a woman who wanted to be loved, who was afraid of the dark, who was sad and cried when she encountered difficulties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone wants to save the world, and I want to stay and help my mom with the dishes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many kinds of beauty, and Mom you are one of the most beautiful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for not being Superman, but for being all-powerful for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love has no direction, but you are the navigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mom doesn&rsquo;t remember Mother&rsquo;s Day, and the day you come home is the holiday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want beach island carriages and castles, I don&rsquo;t want crowds of people screaming with enthusiasm, I don&rsquo;t want bright and glorious lights, I just want you to be proud of me one day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mom, love you 3000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presumably, there are no angels on earth, hence the presence of the Mother.</p>
</li>
