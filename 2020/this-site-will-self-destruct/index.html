<p>Dear Website,I just finished a 15 hour shift at the hospital. I’m a doctor in Australia. We’re so lucky here, and I feel awful about how supportive our community is for us in a situation frankly overstated in our part of the world. My thoughts go to those in Europe and America right now, where they truly need packed meals ect</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am thinking of not talking to my mother any longer. It both makes me sad and relieved to contemplate this course of action. I wish I could talk with her about why but she seems unable and unwilling to acknowledge the hurt she caused while I was growing up. I am unsure how to address this because it’s been affecting my life for so long. I have to put up boundaries and talking with her at all makes me mad or depressed. I feel like she doesn’t let me get mad at her but I’m so mad that I never want to talk to her or see her again. Not even if she dies and goes in the ground. I want to live as if she were dead already. This goes against what I believe since I am supposed to “honor thy parents”. I’ve been emotionally abused by her from when I was very little until now. What do I do to honor that parent, who gave me life and messed me up for life? I believe I can heal and letting go is apart of that but I feel like harm is something she can’t avoid. How can I grow up and protect myself? Thanks for listening, website. -L</p>

<p>I started to fall in love with my housemate in the beginning of the pandemic, but then quar made me crazy and now we’re in a brutally quiet stalemate, afraid to break up or down or fall in or move anywhere really.</p>

<p>My name is Yoshikage Kira. I’m 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don’t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I’m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I’m trying to explain that I’m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn’t lose to anyone</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For years while I was growing up, I was constantly asked, “What is your goal in life?”. At our school, the students had to go up on stage and talk about their ambition in life. We’d say cliche things like being a doctor, astronaut, football player, cricketer etc. Now, I’m finally sure of what my ambition in life is: being happy, practising self love, prioritising my peace of mind at every point in life and to try to make choices that reflect this ambition. Lots of love to whoever’s reading this. You’re fine the way you are. xoxo</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As this pandemic worsens I feel myself almost unconsciously trying to reconcile the fact I’m going to rapidly lose one if not both of my at-risk parents, even though they’re practicing smart isolating and social distancing. It feels really shitty to think about and it’s not a reality I want to accept but I can’t help myself from acknowledging the looming possibility that I may not have time with them once this is all over.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The world as we know it has come to an end. Just waiting for everyone to wake up to our present reality. Feel like this website is the truest thing I’ve stumbled upon all day</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m using this time to do the work towards healing from my sexual abuse and forgive my family for not protecting me when I was a vulnerable child.</p>
